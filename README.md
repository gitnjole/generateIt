Please don't actually use this as a password generator, not only is it clumsy untill I add more functionality but
it also uses very primitive ways of generating a password, therefore I would reccommend using something like 
https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator


TODO:
Sessions
User pages > Ability to see passwords you saved for later use* 
?Password locker**


*(Is it a horrible idea to save a password that was generated on a random website? Yes. Do I want to learn how to create such a feature? Yes.)
